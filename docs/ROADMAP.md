# xv6-riscv Learning and Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a comprehensive path for learning and enhancing the xv6-riscv operating system. It is designed as a 6-8 month journey, progressing from basic understanding to implementing advanced OS features.

## Timeline Summary

- **Phase 1** (2-3 weeks): Basic xv6 Structure Understanding
- **Phase 2** (3-4 weeks): Interrupt and Trap Mechanisms
- **Phase 3** (4-5 weeks): Advanced Scheduler Implementation
- **Phase 4** (4-5 weeks): Filesystem Improvements
- **Phase 5** (3-4 weeks): Advanced Memory Management
- **Phase 6** (6-8 weeks): Networking Stack Implementation
- **Phase 7** (4-6 weeks): Advanced Features (Containers, Security, Performance)

**Total Duration**: Approximately 26-35 weeks (6-8 months)

## Learning Approach

### 1. Read-Write Balance
- Spend at least 1 hour daily reading existing code
- Start with small modifications before implementing large features
- Understand the "why" behind design decisions

### 2. Debugging Skills
- Master GDB for kernel debugging
- Use printf debugging strategically
- Leverage QEMU monitor for hardware inspection

### 3. Documentation
- Document all implementations
- Record design decisions and trade-offs
- Maintain performance benchmarks

### 4. Testing
- Write tests for each new feature
- Use `test-xv6.py` framework
- Create regression test suites

### 5. Code Review
- Compare implementations with Linux kernel
- Study reference implementations
- Share work with community for feedback

## Phase Progression

Each phase builds upon previous knowledge:

```
Phase 1: Foundation
   ↓
Phase 2: Low-level mechanisms (interrupts, traps)
   ↓
Phase 3: Process management (scheduling)
   ↓
Phase 4: Storage (filesystem)
   ↓
Phase 5: Memory (virtual memory, paging)
   ↓
Phase 6: Networking (TCP/IP stack)
   ↓
Phase 7: Advanced topics (security, containers)
```

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- C programming (pointers, structures, function pointers)
- Computer architecture basics (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Assembly language fundamentals (RISC-V helpful but not required)
- Operating system concepts (processes, memory management, file systems)

### Development Environment
- RISC-V toolchain (riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc or riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc)
- QEMU 7.2+ with riscv64-softmmu support
- GDB with RISC-V support
- Text editor or IDE with C support
- Git for version control

## Success Criteria

For each phase, you should be able to:
1. Explain the concepts theoretically
2. Implement the feature with working code
3. Test the implementation thoroughly
4. Document the design and implementation
5. Measure and analyze performance

## Resources

### Primary Resources
- MIT 6.S081 (Operating System Engineering) lectures and labs
- xv6 Book (RISC-V edition)
- RISC-V Instruction Set Manual

### Reference Materials
- Linux kernel source code (for comparison)
- Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP book)
- Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective

### Community
- xv6 mailing list
- MIT 6.S081 course forum
- Operating systems study groups

```

## Getting Started

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project context
2. Complete Phase 1 to understand xv6 basics
3. Choose features from subsequent phases based on your interests
4. Refer to `docs/specifications/` for detailed implementation guides

## Customization

This roadmap is flexible:
- **Focus areas**: Skip phases that don't align with your goals
- **Pace**: Adjust timeline based on your available time
- **Depth**: Go deeper in areas of interest
- **Order**: Some phases can be done in different order (e.g., Phase 4 and Phase 5 can be swapped)

## Completion Goals

By the end of this roadmap, you will have:
- Deep understanding of OS internals
- Practical experience with low-level systems programming
- A portfolio of OS implementations
- Skills applicable to kernel development, embedded systems, and systems programming

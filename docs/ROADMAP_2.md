# Project Context for Educational Hybrid OS Development

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Develop an educational operating system based on xv6, evolving it into a hybrid kernel architecture inspired by Darwin/XNU.

**Key Characteristics**:

-   Base: xv6 (simple Unix-like teaching OS)
-   Target Architecture: Hybrid kernel (monolithic core + user-space servers)
-   Primary Language: Pure C (C11 standard)
-   Development Methodology: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
-   Multi-architecture support: x86_64 (primary), RISC-V (secondary)
-   Build System: CMake
-   Educational purpose: Focus on learning OS concepts, not production use

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) First

-   All hardware-specific code must be isolated through HAL interfaces
-   HAL must be designed and stabilized in Phase 1
-   Function pointer-based abstraction for testability
-   Thin abstraction layer (minimal overhead)

### 2. Modular Architecture

-   Interface-based design for all major subsystems
-   Clear separation between:
    -   Hardware abstraction (`hal/`)
    -   Architecture-specific code (`arch/x86_64/`, `arch/riscv/`)
    -   Core kernel logic (`core/`)
    -   User-space servers (after Phase 6)

### 3. Testability from Day One

-   Unit tests for all HAL-independent code
-   Mock implementations of HAL for host-based testing
-   Integration tests in QEMU environment
-   End-to-end system tests

### 4. Performance Awareness

-   Benchmarking from Phase 2 onwards
-   Continuous performance regression detection
-   Quantitative validation of design decisions

### Code Organization

-   2-space indentation (no tabs)

3. **IPC Performance**: Phase 6 success depends on efficient IPC
4. **Incremental Progress**: Each phase must be fully completed before moving on
5. **Documentation**: Document design decisions as you go

## What NOT to Include in Specifications

â **Complete code implementations**: Specifications should describe WHAT to build, not HOW in detailed code

â **Copy-paste solutions**: Educational value comes from implementation challenges

â **Full algorithms**: Describe algorithm requirements, not step-by-step pseudocode

â **Instead, provide**:

-   Functional requirements
-   Interface specifications
-   Test criteria
-   Success metrics
-   Design constraints
-   References to existing implementations (xv6, Linux, Darwin)

---

## Estimated Timeline

**Part-time development (10-15 hours/week)**:

-   Total: 22-24 months

**Full-time development (40 hours/week)**:

-   Total: 8-10 months

**Per Phase**:

-   Short phases (2-5 weeks): Focused feature work
-   Long phases (6-8 weeks): Major architectural changes
-   Buffer time: Add 20% for unexpected challenges

---

This context should enable specification documents to be written for each phase, focusing on functional requirements, design constraints, testing criteria, and success metrics, while leaving implementation details as learning exercises.

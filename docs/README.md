## Getting Started

1. **Read** `ROADMAP.md` for overview and learning approach
2. **Start with** Phase 1 to understand xv6 basics
3. **Choose phases** based on your interests and goals
4. **Implement features** following specifications
5. **Test thoroughly** using provided test cases

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Key Features |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Phase 1** | Basic Structure | 2-3 weeks | System calls, process info, tracing |
| **Phase 2** | Interrupts & Traps | 3-4 weeks | Signals, alarms, performance counters |
| **Phase 3** | Scheduling | 4-5 weeks | Priority, MLFQ, CFS, multi-core |
| **Phase 4** | Filesystem | 4-5 weeks | Large files, symlinks, journaling |
| **Phase 5** | Memory | 3-4 weeks | Lazy allocation, COW, mmap, swap |
| **Phase 6** | Networking | 6-8 weeks | TCP/IP stack, sockets, applications |
| **Phase 7** | Advanced | 4-6 weeks | Containers, security, profiling |

## How to Use These Specifications

Each specification document contains:

- **Objectives**: What you'll learn and build
- **Features to Implement**: Specific features with requirements
- **System Calls**: APIs to implement
- **Data Structures**: Structures to add/modify
- **Deliverables**: Checklist of what to complete
- **Success Criteria**: How to know you're done
- **Testing**: Test cases and examples
- **Key Concepts**: Prerequisites to study
- **References**: Resources for deeper learning

## Recommended Approach

### Linear Path (Recommended for Beginners)
Complete phases in order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7

### Custom Path (For Specific Goals)
- **Interested in Networking?** Do 1, 2, then jump to 6
- **Interested in Memory?** Do 1, then jump to 5
- **Interested in Scheduling?** Do 1, 2, then 3
- **Interested in Security?** Do 1, 2, then 7

### Parallel Learning
Some phases can be done in parallel:
- Phase 3 (Scheduling) and Phase 4 (Filesystem) are independent
- Phase 4 (Filesystem) and Phase 5 (Memory) are mostly independent

## Implementation Tips

1. **Read Before Coding**: Understand the feature before implementing
2. **Start Simple**: Implement basic version first, enhance later
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test each small change
4. **Use Git**: Commit working code frequently
5. **Document**: Write down design decisions
6. **Ask for Help**: Use MIT 6.S081 forums, xv6 community

## Testing Strategy

For each feature:
1. Write test before implementing
2. Implement feature
3. Test with your tests
4. Test with existing xv6 tests (`usertests`)
5. Test edge cases and error conditions
6. Measure performance if applicable

## Debugging Tips

- Use `printf()` debugging liberally in kernel
- Use GDB for complex issues (`make qemu-gdb`)
- Check with `make qemu CPUS=1` to reduce concurrency
- Use QEMU monitor (Ctrl-A C) to inspect state
- Read CLAUDE.md for QEMU tips

## Performance Benchmarking

For performance-related features:
- Measure before implementing (baseline)
- Measure after implementing
- Compare and document improvements
- Test with different workloads

## Contributing Enhancements

After implementing features:
- Document your implementation
- Share with community
- Compare with Linux/other OS implementations
- Write blog posts about your learning

## Questions or Issues?

- Check CLAUDE.md for project-specific guidance
- Refer to MIT 6.S081 course materials
- Search xv6 GitHub issues
- Ask on OS development forums

## Progress Tracking

Consider creating a personal log to track:
- Features implemented
- Problems encountered and solved
- Performance measurements
- Lessons learned
- Time spent on each phase

Good luck with your xv6 journey!
